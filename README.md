Part 2: Functional Programming Rebuild

By now you should very much know how to build higher-order functions from scratch. Today you will warm-up on the more important and useful higher order functions: .map(), .reduce() and .filter().

Whiteboard, make a code plan and build each of the following methods:
.map() - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with each item manipulated by that function.

.reduce() - function that takes an array of food orders with their amounts and returns the total amount of all the food orders.

.filter() - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with only the items that return true in the function.
Create a repo called "Higher-Order-From-Scratch".

Practice working from branches by creating a new branch called: "HigherOrder".

Place your code in a file called main.js.

Create a pull request (PR) for Higher-Order-From-Scratch to be merged into master.
